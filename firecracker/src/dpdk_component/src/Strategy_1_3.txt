Strategy_1_2 did not work, mutexes were not enough for synch.

Found an idea:

put the array inside a Box and use two channels to sychronize access on it.

thread A waits to get the Box from B before writing on the array.
thread B waits to get the Box from A before reading the array.

Going to create another branch for this.

-----------------------------
Am implementat strategia, dupa ce am facut si transmiterea de la Secondary
catre microVM, am facut un deadlock.

Trebuie sa ma gandesc la un mod de a scapa de deadlock.
Am pus recv_timeout(5) momentan si se vede unde raman threadurile
pt ca iese cu panic.

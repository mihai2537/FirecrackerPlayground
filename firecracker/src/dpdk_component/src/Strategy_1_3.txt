Strategy_1_2 did not work, mutexes were not enough for synch.

Found an idea:

put the array inside a Box and use two channels to sychronize access on it.

thread A waits to get the Box from B before writing on the array.
thread B waits to get the Box from A before reading the array.

Going to create another branch for this.

In this strategy I will try to use shared memory to pass data from
device.rs thread to client thread and vice versa.

The plan is to use Arc<Mutex<buffer>> inside device.rs
 

 --------------------------------------
 Start by replacing tx_frame_buf

 I replaced the tx_frame_buf but the implementation seems to be buggy
 Wireshark reports errors regarding the packets size.

I still send through the channel the size of the array.

Perhaps stop casting the size of the array?

I have found a possible issue:

the secondary dpdk thread is not reaching the mutex on tx_buffer on time.
The lock is grasped by the firecracker thread 2 times in a row.

I need some mechanism like wait_on.

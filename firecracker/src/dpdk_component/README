OLD README from another package.

trying to get access to rte_mbuf structure.

I got access to rte_ring_dequeue, but not tested yet.
I try to compile my own .c file which wraps the rte_ring_dequeue because it is static inline.

bindgen command:

bindgen --generate-inline-functions include/static-functions.h -o src/bindingsMbuf.rs -- -include rte_config.h -march=native -I/usr/local/include


WARNING:

Something strange happened.
Every time I was trying to eal_init, I got an error.
The error disappeared after starting the dpdk_reader_server serve app.
Some packets were received, which is strange.

Only after running that app, I was able to start other programs to work with eal_init.
